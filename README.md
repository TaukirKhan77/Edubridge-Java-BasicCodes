# Edubridge-Java-BasicCodes

This repository contains a collection of basic Java code examples aimed at beginners. These examples help demonstrate core Java programming concepts and syntax.

## Introduction
This repository includes simple Java programs designed to teach fundamental concepts such as:
- *Variables and Data Types*: Understanding primitive types and variable declaration.
- *Control Flow*: Using if-else statements, loops (for, while), and switch-case.
- *Arrays*: Basic array operations and iteration.
- *Methods and Functions*: Creating and using methods for code reusability.
- *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*: Basics of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Java Topics Covered
- *Variables and Data Types*: Introduction to Java's primitive data types (int, float, char, etc.).
- *Loops*: Examples demonstrating for-loops, while-loops, and do-while loops.
- *Conditionals*: Using if, else-if, else, and switch-case statements for decision-making.
- *Arrays*: How to declare, initialize, and iterate over arrays.
- *Functions/Methods*: Writing functions for code modularity and reusability.
- *Classes and Objects*: Basic implementation of classes and objects to demonstrate OOP concepts.

## Usage
